# Circadian-Neural-Reward-Sensitivity
In this project (manuscript in preparation) - 
- We use the EEG signal called the RewP (Reward Positivity), an event-related potential (ERP) evoked by the Doors Gambling task. Participants win 50 cents for every correct door they choose and lose 25 cents for every incorrect door.
- The RewP is a measure of the brain's responsiveness, or sensitivity, to rewards (here, monetary rewards).
- We model the circadian rhythm of reward sensitivity of over 500 participants from 7 EEG studies.
- We explore the role of previous night's sleep in reward sensitivity.

This project is led by Geetika Kapoor, a postbaccalaureate researcher in Clinical Psychology and Neuroscience at UC Berkeley, under the direction of Keanan Joyner, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychology at UC Berkeley.
